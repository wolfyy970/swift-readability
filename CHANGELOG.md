# Changelog

Notable changes to SwiftReadability are documented here. The project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) while its public API matures.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.2] - 2026-07-20

### Security

- Replaced a credential-shaped Google browser API key copied into the upstream
  BuzzFeed compatibility fixture with a non-secret placeholder. Extraction
  expectations and runtime behavior are unchanged.

### Changed

- Removed obsolete development-only comparison trees and local workflow
  material from the maintained standalone ancestry. Production sources, public
  API, and library behavior are unchanged from 0.3.1.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- Refined package documentation and synthetic DOM regression fixture names;
  library behavior is unchanged.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- Removed the client-specific aggregate extension preset. Consumers now compose
  the granular recovery and cleanup flags they need, keeping application policy
  outside the reusable library.
- Renamed the internal enhanced-fixture profile and implementation identifiers
  around their neutral publisher-adaptation responsibilities.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- Made Mozilla Readability commit `ab4027a` the executable behavioral authority;
  the inherited Lake of Fire port remains credited provenance and scaffolding,
  not the compatibility specification.
- Reworked default extraction, metadata, DOM cleanup, serialization, JavaScript
  string/number/regular-expression semantics, and readerability behavior around
  focused pinned-oracle regressions.
- Pinned SwiftSoup 2.13.6 and WebURL 0.4.2; browser-style URL resolution no longer
  relies on Foundation URL heuristics.
- Moved Mozilla JavaScript sources out of the production library and into an
  optional, byte-verified reference product.

### Added

- A fail-closed 136-fixture Swift-versus-Mozilla result differential under true
  default options, with exact serialized output, a supplemental canonical-DOM
  diagnostic, strict raw-input comment overlays, CSSOM oracle cases, and
  focused edge-case tests.
- Explicit opt-in `ReadabilityExtensions` for isolated publisher cleanup,
  content recovery, media handling, and ruby normalization while keeping
  default behavior extension-free.
- Release-mode benchmark, immutable dependency, provenance, license, and native
  Linux compatibility gates.

### Fixed

- Unicode range crashes, cross-run mutable state, falsy option handling, HTML
  document traversal, language/direction discovery, link density, lazy image and
  URL property semantics, table span parsing, structured metadata edge cases,
  comment preservation, and browser serialization differences.
